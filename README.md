# -Simple-Calculator-in-C-
his is a beginner-friendly C++ program that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is prompted to input two numbers and select an operator to execute the desired calculation.
Here’s a clean and engaging GitHub description you can use for your calculator project:

---

### ✨ Features
- Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` operations
- Interactive console input
- Clear output formatting
- Basic error handling for division

### 📌 How It Works
1. The user enters an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
2. Inputs two floating-point numbers
3. The program uses a `switch` statement to perform the selected operation
4. Displays the result in a readable format

### 🚀 Getting Started
To run the program:
```bash
g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
```

### 🛠️ Future Improvements
- Add modulus `%` support for integers
- Handle division by zero more robustly
- Include input validation and loop for multiple operations
